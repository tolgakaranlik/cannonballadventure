This project is not being maintained and has known issues. This repository is being published for two purposes:

My personal reference
To help people who are trying to develop similar things. Such people can copy the source code they see here but all assets are forbidden to be copied or used in anywhere else for any purposes.
Please do not ask me to:

Correct some issue in the code
Explain why things have been done in this way
Describe the function of some fragment within the porject
Write additional code
Refactor some part of the project in order to work compatible with yours
I am really busy on 105% of my time so I cannot teach anyone anything. The only favor I can make for you is to share my code so you can see for yourself how things to be done and/or copy any fragment you need.
